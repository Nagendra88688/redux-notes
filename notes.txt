* Redux is a predictable state container for JS applications.
* React - redux is a seperate library that provides bindings to use React & Redux together in applications.

* Three core concepts:
  1. A 'Store' that holds the state of your application.
  2. An 'Action' that describes the changes in state of application.
  3. A 'Reducer' which actually carries out the state transition, depending on the action.


* What are the three principles in redux :
  1. The state of your whole application is stored in an object tree within a single store.
  2. The only way to change the state is to dispatch an action, an object describing what happened.
  3. To specify how the state tree is transformed by actions, you write pure reducers.
     (Pure reducer is a function that accepts prev. state and action, and returns new state)

* Actions: 
 - plain javascript objects.
 - have a "type" property that indicates the type of action being performed.


* Middleware:
  - provides a third-party extension point b/w dispatching an action, and the moment it reaches the reducer.
  - use Middleware for logging, crash reporting, performing async tasks, etc.
  - a middleware called Redux thunk allows us to perform asynchronous operations in actionCreator function
    Ex =>  const store = redux.createStore(reducer, applyMiddleware(thunkMiddleware));
           store.dispatch(fetchUsers())  //this fetchUsers actionCreator can now return a function that can 
           perform async task like network request, taking 'dispatch' function as a parameter.


* Why should you dispatch an action to update the state and not update store directly in redux? 
  - By dispatching actions, you make state changes predictable and easier to trace.
  - When you dispatch an action, middleware can intercept it, perform some asynchronous logic.
  - It enhances the maintainability and debugging of your application.


* What are some of the major features of Redux DevTools?
  - time travel environment that makes it possible for us to live edit in Redux with a variety of functionalities like action replay
  - makes it possible for us to inspect all the states and action payload
